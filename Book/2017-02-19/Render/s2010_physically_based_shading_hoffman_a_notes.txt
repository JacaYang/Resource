cspec looks like an ideal parameter for a Fresnel re¡ãectance approximation, and indeed Schlick [22]
gives a cheap and reasonably accurate approximation that uses it:
FSchlick(cspec; l; n) = cspec + (1 ? cspec)(1 ? (l ¡é n))5 (5)
This approximation is widely used in computer graphics. In the special case of active microfacets,
h must be substituted for the surface normal n:
FSchlick(cspec; l; h) = cspec + (1 ? cspec)(1 ? (l ¡é h))5
