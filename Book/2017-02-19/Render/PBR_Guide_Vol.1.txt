2. Fresnel. The BRDF is handled by the shader. The F0 reflectance value has minimal change
for most common dielectrics and falls within a range of 2% - 5%. The F0 for metals is a high
value ranging from 70-100%.

4. Lighting calculations are computed in linear space. All maps that have gamma-encoded
values such as base color or diffuse are usually converted by the shader to linear, but you may
have to make sure that the conversion is properly done by checking the appropriate option
when importing the image in your game engine or renderer. Maps that describe surface
attributes such as roughness, glossiness, metallic and height should be set to be interpreted as
linear.

F(0) = 0.02
The F0 range for most common
dielectrics will be from 0.02 - 0.05 and
for conductors the F0 range will be
0.5-1.0.


Thus, the reflectivity of a
surface is determined by the refractive
index as shown in the following
equation from Sebastien Lagarde's
"Feeding a Physically-based Shading
Model" blog post as shown in figure 10.


Non-metals
(dielectrics/insulators) will have a
greyscale value and metals (conductors)
will have an RGB value. With
