5.2 Parameters
 baseColor - the surface color, usually supplied by texture maps.
 subsurface - controls diuse shape using a subsurface approximation.
 metallic - the metallic-ness (0 = dielectric, 1 = metallic). This is a linear blend between two
dierent models. The metallic model has no diuse component and also has a tinted incident
specular, equal to the base color.
 specular - incident specular amount. This is in lieu of an explicit index-of-refraction.

 specularTint - a concession for artistic control that tints incident specular towards the base color.
Grazing specular is still achromatic.
 roughness - surface roughness, controls both diuse and specular response.
 anisotropic - degree of anisotropy. This controls the aspect ratio of the specular highlight. (0 =
isotropic, 1 = maximally anisotropic).
 sheen - an additional grazing component, primarily intended for cloth.
 sheenTint - amount to tint sheen towards base color.
 clearcoat - a second, special-purpose specular lobe.
 clearcoatGloss - controls clearcoat glossiness (0 = a \satin" appearance, 1 = a \gloss" appearance).

5.3 Diuse model details
Some models include a diuse Fresnel factor such as:
(1 ô€€€ F(l))(1 ô€€€ F(d))
where F() is the Fresnel factor for re
ection.
